# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 19, 2025

At **SleepIQ**, we believe that what happens in your bedroom should stay in your bedroom. Unlike other sleep trackers that upload your audio to cloud servers, SleepIQ is designed to be **Privacy-First**.

## 1. Data Collection & Storage
**We do not collect or store your personal sleep data on our servers.**

* **Sleep Data:** Your movement, heart rate (via Apple Health), and respiratory rates are stored locally in a secure database on your device.
* **Audio Recordings:** Snore and sleep talk recordings are processed locally. They never leave your phone unless you explicitly export them.
* **Deletion:** Deleting the app instantly removes all data associated with it. We cannot recover this data for you because we do not have a copy.

## 2. Permissions We Request
* **Microphone:** Used solely to analyze sound waves during sleep sessions. Audio is analyzed in real-time.
* **Motion & Fitness:** Used to detect body movement to determine sleep phases (Awake, Light, Deep).
* **Apple Health (HealthKit):**
  * **Read:** We read Heart Rate to correlate with sleep stages.
  * **Write:** We save your "In Bed" and "Asleep" durations to Apple Health so your rings close.

## 3. Third-Party Analytics
We use **aggregated, anonymous** analytics (e.g., Firebase, Aptabase) to improve app stability.
* **What is sent:** Crash reports, app launch success rates, device model.
* **What is NOT sent:** Audio clips, sleep graphs, health vitals, or personally identifiable information.

## 4. Local Weather Data
To provide the "Weather Correlation" feature, the app fetches local weather data using your approximate location (City level). This location data is processed ephemerally and is not stored or tracked history.
