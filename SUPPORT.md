# SleepIQ Support Center

We are here to help you get the best night's sleep possible.

## Knowledge Base

### Common Questions
* **"Why is the Smart Alarm waking me up early?"**
  * The Smart Alarm is designed to wake you *up to 30 minutes before* your set time if it detects you are in a light sleep phase. This prevents you from falling back into deep sleep and waking up groggy.
* **"Does SleepIQ work in Airplane Mode?"**
  * **Yes!** SleepIQ is an offline-first app. We recommend using Airplane Mode to reduce radiation and battery usage during the night.
* **"Where is my data stored?"**
  * All data is stored in a secure SQLite database directly on your iPhone. We do not have access to your recordings.

### Troubleshooting Audio
If the app isn't recording snoring:
1. Ensure **Microphone Permissions** are enabled in iOS Settings.
2. Place your phone **face down** on your nightstand (microphone facing out).
3. Do not place the phone *under* your pillow as it may overheat and muffle the microphone.
