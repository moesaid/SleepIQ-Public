**Master your sleep. Wake up refreshed.**

## Welcome to SleepIQ
SleepIQ is a next-generation sleep monitor that turns your device into a comprehensive sleep laboratory. Unlike traditional alarms that jolt you awake, SleepIQ uses advanced audio processing and accelerometer data to wake you during your lightest sleep phase ensuring you start your day feeling energized, not groggy.

Designed for privacy-conscious users, SleepIQ processes all data locally on your device. We combine clinical-grade sleep analysis with local weather correlation to help you understand exactly what impacts your rest.
